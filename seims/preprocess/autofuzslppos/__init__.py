Python for Automatic Fuzzy Slope Positions including data preparation, running model, etc.

 Currently, the five basic slope position types are supported, i.e., ridge,
     shoulder slope, back slope, foot slope and valley.
 TODO, 11 slope positions considering the concavity and convexity along both
     the contour and profile directions will be considered in the future.
